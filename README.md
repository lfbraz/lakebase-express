# Lakebase Express

A Databricks App that guides you through migrating a transactional database to
**Databricks Lakebase** (managed serverless Postgres), through a connector
catalog. It's a **migration engine, not a code generator**: you review and edit
each artifact, and the app applies the schema/code and streams the data into
Lakebase itself, with live progress.

Enabled sources today: **Azure SQL** and **SQL Server**. More (Oracle,
PostgreSQL, MySQL, …) "Coming soon".

> **Disclaimer.** This is **not an official Databricks product or service**. It is
> an independent, community/solution accelerator provided **"as is", without any
> warranty or support commitment**, and carries **no SLA**. Databricks is not
> liable for its use. **You are solely responsible** for reviewing every generated
> artifact, validating the migration against your own requirements, testing on
> non-production data first, securing credentials, and verifying the results
> before relying on them. Migrating databases is inherently risky — always keep
> verified backups of your source and target. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for the
> full terms.

> **Try it in dev/QA first.** Point the app at a non-production source and a
> throwaway Lakebase target until you've seen a full cycle — assessment, plan,
> apply, data load, validation — succeed on your own schema. Plan items execute
> real DDL against the target and the data load can truncate target tables, so a
> first run belongs somewhere you can drop and recreate.

## Prerequisites

- **Databricks CLI** ≥ 0.239, authenticated to your workspace
  (`databricks auth login`) — used to deploy the app.
- **Node.js** and **npm** — to build the React frontend.
- **Python** 3.10+ (tested on 3.13) — for local development and running tests.
- A **Databricks workspace** with a **Lakebase** database instance (the migration
  target).
- A **source database** — Azure SQL or SQL Server — reachable from the app
  (a firewall rule for the app's egress IP, or a private link).
- A **Databricks secret scope** holding the Lakebase role password under
  `lakebase-password` — the app errors on every request without it. The app runs as
  its own service principal, which needs an ACL on that scope; `deploy.sh` grants
  it, provided you hold **MANAGE** there.

The scan and assessment run without a Databricks workspace; the Foundation Model
features and the Job-offload/Async data paths require one, plus
[grants on `system.ai`](#foundation-model-access-unity-catalog-grants). The source
login needs [three grants](#source-database-grants) to be assessable.

## Quick Start

Deploy it as a Databricks App.

```bash
# 1. Authenticate the CLI (pick any profile name)
databricks auth login --host <workspace-url> --profile <your-profile>

# 2. Set your deploy target — which workspace the bundle deploys to.
#    target.yml is gitignored (per-user), so create it from the sample:
cp target.yml.sample target.yml
#    Then edit target.yml:
#      * name the target after your CLI profile (<your-profile>), so deploy.sh
#        matches them automatically;
#      * set projects_pg_host / projects_pg_user to your Lakebase instance and
#        role (required — the app won't start without them).

# 3. Create the secret scope and store the Lakebase role password in it.
#    Required with the default `postgres` project store — the app reads this key
#    the first time it touches the store, and errors on every request without it.
databricks secrets create-scope lakebase-express --profile <your-profile>
databricks secrets put-secret lakebase-express lakebase-password --profile <your-profile>

# 4. Build the SPA, deploy the bundle, grant scope access, and start the app
DATABRICKS_PROFILE=<your-profile> ./deploy.sh
```

`deploy.sh` builds `frontend/dist`, runs `databricks bundle deploy`, grants the
app's service principal `WRITE` on the secret scope, then `databricks bundle run`
to launch the app. When it finishes it prints the app URL — open it and:

1. **New migration** → pick a source connector.
2. **Connections & Target** — enter the source (Azure SQL / SQL Server) and the
   Lakebase target, and test both.
3. Work through **Assessment → Schema & Code → Data Migration → Create Sync** to
   scan, plan, and run the migration.
4. After migrating, use the **Post-migration** modules — **Validation** and
   **Query Parity** — to confirm the target matches the source.

Deployment knobs and the permissions the app's service principal needs are in
[Deploy as a Databricks App](#deploy-as-a-databricks-app). To iterate on the code
without redeploying, see [Local development](#local-development).

## What it does

Work is organized into **migration projects** — a saved unit (source/target
config, object selection, assessment, plan, run history) you create, leave, and
resume. Passwords are never stored; optional workspace-bound secret scope/key
references are. Projects persist to a local dir (dev) or a UC volume
(`LBX_PROJECTS_BACKEND=volume`) or Lakebase (`=postgres`).

Modules are **independent and always enabled** — no forced sequence. Connections
are configured once and reused; other modules show a soft hint if something is
missing.

| Module | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Connection & Assessment** | Deterministic scan (schema, data types, T-SQL objects) + rule-based compatibility report, augmented by an AI migration analysis (complexity, effort, deeper risks) |
| **Sizing & Cost** | Map source capacity → Lakebase CUs + cost |
| **Schema & Code** | Build an editable plan (DDL + AI-translated code) and apply it to Lakebase |
| **Data Migration** | Stream data into Lakebase (batched `COPY`) with live per-table progress |
| **Create Sync** | Sync now (in-app) or offload a re-runnable PySpark snapshot to a Databricks Job (run now, create unstarted, or schedule) |
| **Validation** *(post-migration)* | Re-scan both sides and match every object — existence, structure, column collations, exact row counts, plus constraints, indexes, and foreign keys — then remediate with an autonomous AI repair agent, one-shot AI fixes, or manual SQL |
| **Query Parity** *(post-migration)* | Generate N synthetic read-only queries, run each against both sides, and compare row count, result format, and performance — with a side-by-side result preview on any mismatch |

Target identifiers are lower-cased by default (PostgreSQL convention); a project
can instead **preserve source casing** (double-quoted, case-sensitive). System
objects (`sys`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, `is_ms_shipped`, …) are never migrated.

### Collations

Column collations are **translated, not dropped**. SQL Server's usual collations
are case-insensitive (`SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`, the Azure SQL default) and
PostgreSQL's default is case-sensitive, so ignoring them silently changes results —
`'ana' = 'ANA'`, sort order, `GROUP BY`, unique indexes — without raising an error.

Each source collation becomes an ICU collation created before the tables using it,
and every character column carries a `COLLATE` clause. Strength maps to an ICU
level (`CI_AS` → `level2`, `CI_AI` → `level1`, `CS_AS` → `level3`), the locale to
the closest ICU tag, and `_BIN`/`_BIN2` to the built-in `C`.

Case- or accent-insensitive collations must be **nondeterministic** — otherwise
equality stays byte-wise and only sorting changes. The assessment flags every
affected column (`COLLATION_INSENSITIVE`) and any CHECK or filtered index that
pattern-matches one (`COLLATION_PATTERN_MATCH`, which will fail to apply);
Validation compares each target column's collation and reports drift with a fix.

**Queries that `LIKE` those columns must be rewritten.** PostgreSQL rejects
pattern matching on a nondeterministic collation, so put a deterministic
collation on the operand and use `ILIKE` to keep the case-insensitive result:

```sql
WHERE email LIKE '%gmail%'                  -- ERROR: not supported for LIKE
WHERE email COLLATE "C" ILIKE '%gmail%'     -- same rows as the source
```

Two traps: plain `LIKE` after `COLLATE "C"` is case-**sensitive** (fewer rows than
the source), and `lower(email) LIKE lower(?)` is rejected too — `lower()`'s result
keeps the column's collation. For an accent-*insensitive* source collation
(`..._CI_AI`), `ILIKE` alone still under-matches; wrap both sides in `unaccent()`
(available on Lakebase via `CREATE EXTENSION unaccent`).

## How it works

- **Backend** (`backend/`) is pure Python with no web framework in the migration
  logic, so it's reusable from notebooks and unit-testable without Databricks.
  The source scan uses `pymssql` (no Spark, no system ODBC driver) and reads only
  small catalog result sets.
- **Schema & code** — the assessment becomes editable `PlanItem`s applied to
  Lakebase in dependency order, each in its own transaction so a failure is
  isolated and reported.
- **Data** — tables stream via `fetchmany` + bulk `COPY` on a background thread
  the UI polls; large tables can be offloaded to a Databricks Job or a PySpark
  **snapshot** (range-partitioned reads → per-partition `COPY`, tables loaded
  concurrently, idempotent re-runs).
- **Collations** are mirrored as ICU collations created before the tables whose
  columns reference them, so string comparison keeps the source's case/accent
  semantics (see [Collations](#collations)).
- **Constraints, indexes, FKs, and triggers** are created **after** the data
  load, so the bulk copy pays no per-row maintenance and identity sequences sync
  to `MAX+1` once rows exist.
- **Post-migration** — Validation re-inventories both sides and diffs them
  through the naming rules; Query Parity runs generated read-only queries on both
  sides and compares the results. Both run on background threads with polled
  progress. Constraints, indexes, and foreign keys are compared as one row per
  table per kind ("5 of 5 present") rather than one row per object — a real
  database has hundreds — and an expanded row names exactly what differs.

## Architecture

```
app.yaml       Databricks Apps runtime config
backend/       FastAPI + all migration logic (framework-free, unit-testable)
frontend/      React + Vite + TypeScript SPA (built to frontend/dist/)
tests/         Pure-Python unit tests
```

In production the SPA is built and served by the same FastAPI process. Database
passwords are typed per session or referenced by a workspace-bound Databricks
secret scope/key (including Key Vault-backed scopes on Azure).

The app is bound to exactly **one** Databricks workspace, not selectable in the
UI: locally the CLI profile it was started with, and when deployed the workspace
the App is published in. Restart with a different profile to switch.

## Local development

To iterate on the code without redeploying, run the two processes locally:

```bash
# Backend (FastAPI) — from the repo root
pip install -r requirements.txt
DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=<your-profile> uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (React + Vite) — separate shell; proxies /api -> :8000
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open the printed Vite URL (default http://localhost:5173).

`DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE` is a profile from `~/.databrickscfg` and picks the
workspace for the whole session. Settings shows which one is connected.

### Foundation Model access (Unity Catalog grants)

The AI features need both grants on `system.ai` for your user (locally) or the app's
service principal (deployed):

```sql
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA system.ai TO `<principal>`;
GRANT EXECUTE    ON SCHEMA system.ai TO `<principal>`;
```

Verify:

```bash
databricks serving-endpoints query databricks-claude-opus-4-8 \
  --json '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"ping"}],"max_tokens":16}' \
  --profile <your-profile>
```

### Choosing the model and the API

Pick the model per session in **Settings → Foundation Model endpoint**, or change
the default with `LBX_FM_ENDPOINT`:

```bash
LBX_FM_ENDPOINT=databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5 \
DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=<your-profile> ./run_local.sh
```

`LBX_FM_API` selects which API carries the chat calls. Both reach the same model
and differ only in how it is named:

| `LBX_FM_API` | Request | Accepted names |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `serving` | `POST /serving-endpoints/{name}/invocations` | endpoint name: `databricks-claude-opus-4-8` |
| `gateway` (default) | `POST /ai-gateway/mlflow/v1/chat/completions` | endpoint name **or** the gateway model id: `system.ai.claude-opus-4-8` |

`gateway` is the default and the route the AI Gateway console's sample request
uses, so the `system.ai.*` ids copied from there work as-is:

```bash
LBX_FM_API=gateway LBX_FM_ENDPOINT=system.ai.claude-opus-4-8 \
DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=<your-profile> ./run_local.sh
```

In gateway mode Settings lists both forms for each pay-per-token endpoint. Note
the `system.ai.<model>` id drops the endpoint's `databricks-` prefix, and that it
is *not* a Unity Catalog path — the registered model is
`system.ai.databricks-claude-opus-4-8`. Passing a `system.ai.*` id in `serving`
mode fails with `ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND`, since that route takes the name from the
URL path.

Deployed, set these through the bundle: `fm_endpoint` and `fm_api` in
`target.yml` (see `target.yml.sample`).

## Run tests

```bash
pip install pytest httpx   # httpx backs FastAPI's TestClient
pytest tests/
```

## Deploy as a Databricks App

Deployment is an Asset Bundle (`databricks.yml`) orchestrated by `deploy.sh` (see
the [Quick Start](#quick-start) for the end-to-end steps). It builds the SPA, runs
`databricks bundle deploy`, grants the app's service principal access to the secret
scope, then `databricks bundle run` to start the app.

**Deploy targets** live in `target.yml`, a per-user file that is **gitignored** so
no workspace-specific config is committed. Copy `target.yml.sample` to `target.yml`
and set your target name; `databricks.yml` pulls it in via its `include:` list. No
workspace host is committed — auth comes from the CLI profile named after the
target (deploy.sh default), an explicit `DATABRICKS_PROFILE`, or a `workspace.host`
you add in `target.yml`.

Knobs (see the header of `deploy.sh`): `--skip-build` reuses `frontend/dist`;
`BUNDLE_TARGET=<target>` picks a target from `target.yml`;
`DATABRICKS_PROFILE=<profile>` pins a CLI profile; `APP_NAME=<name>` overrides the
app name; `LBX_SECRET_ACL=READ` and `LBX_SKIP_ACL=1` control the secret-scope grant.
To deploy to another workspace, add a target to `target.yml` and run
`BUNDLE_TARGET=<target> ./deploy.sh`.

> **Permissions.** `deploy.sh` grants the app's service principal access to the
> secret scope; doing so needs **MANAGE** on that scope. You must still give the app
> network access to the source DB endpoint (firewall rule for its egress IP, or
> private link). Async-mode runtime scopes need scope create/write. Passwords are
> never stored in clear text.

## Adding a source connector

1. **Frontend** — set `enabled: true` and add connection-form hints in
   `frontend/src/connectors.ts`. Optionally drop a logo at
   `frontend/public/logos/<id>.svg`.
2. **Backend** — register the connector's `source_type` in
   `backend/connectors/factory.py`. For a non-T-SQL dialect, add a connector
   exposing `database`, `query(sql) -> list[dict]`, and `test_connection()`; the
   scanner is connector-agnostic.

## Limitations

- Data-type coercion is light: `bit`→`boolean` is handled; other edge types rely
  on psycopg adapters and surface as a per-table error rather than dropping rows.
- Check constraints, defaults, and filtered-index predicates are translated
  mechanically; anything unrecognized passes through verbatim and fails visibly
  at apply time for review.
- Run state is in-process memory — fine for a single-user App; use a table/Redis
  for multi-worker deployments.
- **Lakebase auth in lakebase-express is native Postgres roles only** — a role name
  and password over the Postgres wire protocol. Databricks identity auth
  (OAuth/OIDC for users, service principals, or groups) is **not** supported yet,
  so target access isn't governed by workspace RBAC and doesn't inherit SSO/MFA or
  short-lived credentials. TLS is always required and passwords are never stored in
  clear text, but a long-lived role password is a shared secret you must rotate
  yourself: use a dedicated least-privilege role, and prefer a **private network
  path** (Private Link / private endpoints) over a public endpoint with an IP
  allowlist. OAuth support is on the [Roadmap](#roadmap).
- Job-offload and Async-mode paths require a live workspace and expect the schema
  plan to have created the target tables. Key Vault-backed runtime scopes work
  only when the keys already exist (Databricks can't write through to them).
- `money`/`smallmoney` arithmetic differs between the two engines even though the
  type mapping itself is lossless — see
  [`money` and fixed-scale arithmetic](#money-and-fixed-scale-arithmetic).

### `money` and fixed-scale arithmetic

`money`/`smallmoney` map to `numeric(19,4)`/`numeric(10,4)` — lossless: same scale,
full range, no stored value changes. The **arithmetic** differs. T-SQL `AVG()` over a
`money` column [returns `money`][avg], truncating the division to four decimals inside
the aggregate; Postgres `avg(numeric)` rounds at the end instead. Same data, same
query, one digit apart (for example, `254759.0624` vs `254759.0625`).

According to the Microsoft documentation:

> You can experience rounding errors through truncation, when storing monetary values
> as **money** and **smallmoney**. Avoid using this data type if your money or
> currency values are used in calculations. Instead, use the **decimal** data type
> with at least four decimal places.
> — [money and smallmoney (Transact-SQL)][money]

Only division is exposed — `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX` are exact on both sides. Worth
reviewing where a divided `money` value is written back to a column and feeds later
calculations, since truncation always biases the same way and accumulates. Converting
`MONEY` → `DECIMAL(19,4)` on the source before migrating avoids it entirely.

Query Parity reports these as mismatches, correctly — the two sides really do return
different values. Expand the row to see the side-by-side preview: matching counts and
sums with a difference confined to the last decimal point to this behaviour rather
than to missing or altered data.

## Troubleshooting

### `npm install` fails with `ENOTFOUND` on every package

The lockfile pins a private npm mirror that your network can't reach, and its
host wins over your configured registry. `frontend/package-lock.json` is kept on
the public registry to prevent this — npm still downloads from a mirror in your
`~/.npmrc` if you have one.

If you commit from behind a mirror, run `npm run lockfile:check` in `frontend/`
first (`lockfile:normalize` fixes it).

### Source database grants

The source user needs some read only grants:

```sql
GRANT CONNECT             TO [<login>];
GRANT VIEW DEFINITION     TO [<login>];  -- object definitions to translate
GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO [<login>];  -- row counts
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [<login>];
```

Nothing ever writes to the source — no `db_datawriter`, `db_ddladmin`, or
`db_owner` is required.

Run `scripts/source_grants.sql` to apply all of the above (idempotent, one run per
database); it ends with a verification query. If a scan still fails or comes back
short, `scripts/assessment_scan_queries.sql` runs the scanner's queries
individually to show which one is the problem.

### Testing and debugging the source connection

`scripts/azure_sql_connect.py` reproduces a failing **Test connection** from a
terminal. It drives the same code path as the app (`build_connector` →
`AzureSqlConnection`) outside FastAPI — same `pymssql` driver, login/query
timeouts, and transient-error retry (serverless auto-pause resume, `40613`) — then
runs two cheap catalog queries, so it's safe against production.

```bash
# Coordinates come from the environment (nothing workspace-specific committed)
export LBX_SRC_HOST="<server>.database.windows.net"
export LBX_SRC_DATABASE="<db>"
export LBX_SRC_USER="<login>"
export LBX_SRC_PASSWORD="<password>"
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/azure_sql_connect.py

# Or keep them in a file the probe parses itself
cp .vscode/azure_sql.env.sample .vscode/azure_sql.env   # gitignored — fill it in
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/azure_sql_connect.py --env-file .vscode/azure_sql.env
```

To step through it in VS Code, use the **Azure SQL probe (env file)** launch
configuration in `.vscode/launch.json`, which reads `.vscode/azure_sql.env` and
pins the interpreter that has `pymssql` installed.

## Roadmap

Not commitments — the gaps we'd close next, in rough priority order.

- **Databricks identity auth for Lakebase (OAuth/OIDC).** Connect as a Databricks
  user, service principal, or group with short-lived tokens instead of a native
  Postgres role password, so target access is governed by workspace identity and
  inherits SSO/MFA and credential rotation.
- **More source connectors** — Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL. The scanner is
  connector-agnostic; see [Adding a source connector](#adding-a-source-connector).
- **Multi-user run state.** Run state is in-process memory, so the app is
  single-user today; persisting it would allow concurrent users and multi-worker
  deployments.
